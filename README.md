# Classification-of-Smartphones-using-ML-algorithms

* This is an Internship project on which I worked on at TCS iON.
* The main task of the project was to predict price range of the smartphones and Rank them according to their price range.
* The Data which was given to us was already cleaned and preprocessed, so that we can focus on main task.
* In this project Firstly, I did Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the data for better understanding and gaining insights from the data.
* After EDA, I trained different ML classification algorithms on the data to predict the price range of smartphones.
* After training I Cross Validated every model using cross validation for getting the best performing classification model.
